# BIMM143_Project2
Project 2D: Final version of Project 2 to be submitted for BIMM143

## Scientific Question
Are mice such good animal models for diabetes because the insulin receptor substrate-1 gene (IRS1) is similar between mice and humans?

## Scientific Hypothesis: 
If IRS1 is a probable gene for causing type 2 diabetes and mice and humans have similar endocrine systems, then the IRS1 protein sequence and structure between the two animals will be very similar.
